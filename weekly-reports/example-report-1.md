This week, all the teammates are working together on the final project. I really like the way we collaborate. Although we handle different parts of the project, everyone is striving to do their work well and taking responsibility. I want to thank Shm; she has helped me immensely with the communication between the two photon2.

I think I completed my section of the project very well. I finished the circuit and code by myself and overcame many difficulties. I’m satisfied with the final result. Beyond that, I'm proud that when I encountered problems I could not solve on my own, I discussed them with my teammates to find a suitable solution

My team divided everyone’s part and have a good collaboration. We think of the projects together and refine the detail again. I also want to thank our classmates, cuz when I asked them questions about photon connection in maker space, everybody is willing to stop and help me to solve the problem.

I chose to first test with the more familiar Arduino to ensure the smoothness of the code logic. After that, I can transfer the code to the photon platform. I think I did a good job.
