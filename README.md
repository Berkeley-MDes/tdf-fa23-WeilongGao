## First attempt to create a physical prototype.

Due to my background, my previous work primarily focused on the software side, so I have little experience creating physical prototypes. To be honest, I used to avoid this aspect of work because I felt that physical prototypes were limited by the available facilities, whereas software offered more freedom to realize my ideas. However, now that Jacobs Hall has such advanced facilities, it's the perfect time to learn how to create a physical prototype.

### Reflection

Of course, the process wasn't entirely smooth. I made several mistakes while using the laser cutter. The most significant oversight was forgetting to adjust the thickness, resulting in parts of the plywood board not being fully cut through. So, it's quite challenging to separate it from the board.

So it’s like this…

### Final work

While I encountered some challenges, the final product turned out quite well and fits my phone perfectly. My most notable experience was in the laser cutter room. I wasn't very familiar with everything there, but my peers were immensely helpful. They guided me through the process of using the software and editing the AI file. I'm truly grateful for their assistance.
