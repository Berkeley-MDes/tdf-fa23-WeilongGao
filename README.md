## Use Scenario

The most common scenario in which I use a phone stand is when I want to watch videos while eating. In the past, I had to hold the phone in my hand, which was really inconvenient. So I decided to design a phone stand for this purpose.

I have several requirements for this phone stand. First, it should match the height at which I sit, based on ergonomic design. 

**Second, I want it to not look like a typical phone stand, so I can place it on the table as a decoration.**

## Measurement

So, I measured the dimensions of the table, chair, and my sitting height.

I first mocked up a basic scene in Blender to adjust the size and angle of the phone stand. This way, I ensured it met ergonomic standards.

## Design in Grasshopper

Then I used Grasshopper and Rhino to design my phone stand. I created an array containing a 3x3 matrix and placed a cube at each coordinate of the matrix.

 I then modified some cubes in the matrix, reducing the distances between them, to give it a more compelling geometric design.

Now, it works perfectly and I find it incredibly useful for watching videos while I eat.

## Use grasshopper to design my personal phone stand

### Scenario and Pain points

For me, the most frequent occasion to use a phone stand is when I'm having meals and need to watch videos. However, the current phone stand doesn't meet all of my needs, such as the viewing angle and obstructions in front of the screen. Therefore, I have summarized 4 points that need improvement.

1. No obstructions.
2. Titled more to fit the viewing angle.
3. The center of gravity should be more stable.
4. Easier to put the phone on

### Phone stand design

Based on the improvement points, I design the new phone stand which is not that fancy but meet my demands.

### Model with grasshopper

I have never used visual coding tools like Grasshopper before, so it took me a while to figure out what the panels meant. However, I soon discovered that it is not that different from programming in Unity. All I needed to do was find the parameter and figure out which part of the model it controls, and then I could adjust the model as desired.

First, I adjust the prism parameter to cut off the top of the stand, which is blocking my view. Then, I change the base width to make the center of gravity more stable.

With this step, the phone stand looks like this.

The next step is to adjust the viewing angle to make it more ergonomic for me.

The final product is like this. I think it's pretty good - simple but solves all my problems.

### Summarize

My first experience with visual programming tools was pretty good. I didn't need much time to adapt to this different way of programming. It's more intuitive than writing code directly. However, I believe that when the project becomes bigger and more complex, it can be challenging to manage the entire project.

It would be quite interesting to consider how to improve visual programming tools, or whether they are only suitable for small projects. I will search for more information on this topic.

## Reflection

I believe that parametric design is a useful means to explore different possibilities in personality design. However, even with this method, it is still difficult to meet everyone's demands in the way we imagine true personality design. In my opinion, the only way to implement true personality design and provide everyone with the most appropriate product is to combine it with AI. Users really need to simply click a button and receive their ideal product. I am eager to explore this realm further.

## First attempt to create a physical prototype.

Due to my background, my previous work primarily focused on the software side, so I have little experience creating physical prototypes. To be honest, I used to avoid this aspect of work because I felt that physical prototypes were limited by the available facilities, whereas software offered more freedom to realize my ideas. However, now that Jacobs Hall has such advanced facilities, it's the perfect time to learn how to create a physical prototype.

### Reflection

Of course, the process wasn't entirely smooth. I made several mistakes while using the laser cutter. The most significant oversight was forgetting to adjust the thickness, resulting in parts of the plywood board not being fully cut through. So, it's quite challenging to separate it from the board.

So it’s like this…

### Final work

While I encountered some challenges, the final product turned out quite well and fits my phone perfectly. My most notable experience was in the laser cutter room. I wasn't very familiar with everything there, but my peers were immensely helpful. They guided me through the process of using the software and editing the AI file. I'm truly grateful for their assistance.
